# Securedoor
Arduino Based Door Access Control provides security for home, office, shops, banks etc through a security password which is providential for the user alone. Users have the freedom to set a predefined code fortheir locking systems. The system will allow access to the person who knows the password and will not allow access to unauthorized person.

The project presented here is based on arduino and is more simple and reliable than simple micro controller based digital code lock. Here is a LCD display which is used to interface with the project to output lock status. In this project we have an additional advantage that the user can change the password. 
The user will be prompted to set a password at installation. This password inputted at installation will continue to serve the lock until it is change. The program will check for current password and allows the user to change Password only if the current password is input correctly.
Applications: 
It can be used in places where we need more security.
It can also be used in door, lockers, offices, main gate of house, ATM etc.
